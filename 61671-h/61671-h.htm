<h2 class="hidden">A Great Adventure on a Windy March Day</h2>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>1. One day in March, Nurse Jane bought a new rug, and Uncle Wiggily
helped her take it home to the hollow stump bungalow. “If you
hadn’t helped me I never could have carried it,” said the muskrat lady
housekeeper. “My! how hard the wind blows!” Uncle Wiggily could
feel it on his pink, twinkling nose. “The wind is getting worse!” he
shouted. “Hold the rug, Nurse Jane! My hat is blowing off my head!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;">
<img src="images/i004.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>2. Uncle Wiggily let go his end of the rug and reached up to grasp
his hat as it blew off his head. But the wind was so strong that it
filled the tall hat like a balloon, and lifted the bunny rabbit off
his feet. “Uncle Wiggily! Help me!” cried Nurse Jane, as she felt
the March wind beginning to raise the rug and her with it. But the
bunny rabbit gentleman was having troubles of his own. Just look!</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>3. Uncle Wiggily heard Nurse Jane’s cries and knowing that if he
wished to save his housekeeper he would have to let go his hat, he did.
Away it sailed, and then up in the air went the rug, taking the muskrat
lady with it. “Come along, Uncle Wiggily!” shouted Miss Fuzzy
Wuzzy, “I don’t want to go adventuring alone!” The bunny hopped
along until he grasped one corner of the rug. “Pull me up!” he begged.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i006.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>4. Nurse Jane leaned over the edge of the rug, which was like a
raft in the air, and caught hold of Uncle Wiggily. “Up you come!”
she cried. “We’re sailing away on a regular voyage!” “That’s right!”
agreed Uncle Wiggily, twinkling his pink nose very fast. “Mind your
bonnet, Janie! It’ll blow away.” The muskrat lady said she had it tied
by a string so it couldn’t. “How will we ever get down?” she asked.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>5. At last Nurse Jane pulled Uncle Wiggily up on the rug, and there
they were safe for a while, at least. “But what is going to become
of us?” asked the muskrat lady. Uncle Wiggily did not answer. He
seemed to be looking at something in the air. “What is it?” asked
Nurse Jane. “It looks like Mrs. Twistytail, the lady pig,” the bunny
rabbit gentleman answered. “It must be a strong wind to blow her!”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i008.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>6. The wind blew harder and harder. All at once it blew Mrs.
Twistytail along so that she was directly over the rug on which were
sailing Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane. “Quee! Quee!” cried the lady
pig. “Oh, this is terrible!” Nurse Jane whispered and said: “It will be
if she falls on us!” Uncle Wiggily twinkled his nose again. “She
would be a good anchor to bring us to the ground,” said the bunny.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>7. “If you can fall in between us, Mrs. Twistytail,” called Uncle
Wiggily to the lady pig, “you will bear us to the ground.” The lady
pig tried, but she missed the rug and fell on some hay. “Oh dear, we’ll
never get down!” sighed Nurse Jane. “Yes! Yes!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“Mrs. Twistytail struck on some hay and she’s bouncing up!
She will land on us yet and weight us down so that we can land!”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>8. “Mrs. Twistytail! Mrs. Twistytail! This way if you please!”
called Nurse Jane, when the lady pig, lovely and fat, was up in the air
again, above the rug. “Fall here, Mrs. Twistytail, and you’ll help
bear us to the earth!” Mrs. Twistytail squealed: “Quee! Quee! I’ll
do my best,” she grunted. And down she fell, landing on the sailing
rug, safely between Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane. Down they went!</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p>9 “It’s a good thing you landed here with us, Mrs. Twistytail,” said
Nurse Jane, as the pig lady fell softly on the rug. “It’s a good thing
I didn’t alight on a church steeple!” grunted Mrs. Twistytail. “Oh,
I never felt such a wind in all my life!” Uncle Wiggily said he was
glad the pig lady happened to drop in. And then down to the ground
went the rug with a bump. “How jolly!” laughed the Squiggle Bugs.</p>

<h2 class="hidden">How Mr. Longears Showed the Piggy Boys How to Behave in School</h2>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i013.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>1. One day, as he was hopping through the woods, Uncle Wiggily
met Curly and Floppy Twistytail coming from school with their books.
“Why are you so late coming from school?” asked the bunny. “We
were kept in,” grunted Floppy. “For being bad and having fun,”
squealed Curly. “Tut! Tut!” scolded Uncle Wiggily. “You should
be good in school. Tomorrow I’ll go to school and show you how.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i014.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>2. The Lady Mouse Teacher said she would be very glad to have
Uncle Wiggily come to the Hollow Stump School and show the animal
boys and girls how to be good. So the bunny gentleman, next day, took
his place at one of the desks. But you know how it is—Jackie Bow
Wow couldn’t help trying his new bean-blower. “Zip!” went a bean on
Uncle Wiggily’s nose. Right away Uncle Wiggily felt like a boy again.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i015.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>3. “Oh, zippie!” whispered Uncle Wiggily out loud when he felt the
bean sting him on the nose. “I’ll fix you for that, Jackie!” Then,
forgetting he was there to show the pupils how to be good, Uncle
Wiggily threw his wet sponge straight at the doggie boy. “Uncle
Wiggily, I am surprised at you!” squeaked the Lady Mouse Teacher.
“Why did you do that?” But Uncle Wiggily wouldn’t tell why he did it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i016.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>4. “I’ll ask you to come up and sit in the front seat, Uncle Wiggily,”
squeaked the Lady Mouse Teacher sadly. “You said you wanted to
come here to show my pupils how to be good in school, but you are
cutting up worse than any of them ever did.” So the bunny gentleman
took his place in the punish seat. But still he wouldn’t tell that Jackie
had first hit him with a bean. Uncle Wiggily was a “SPORT,” I think.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>5. “Now that Uncle Wiggily sits where he can’t play any more of his
tricks,” squeaked the Lady Mouse, “we shall go on with our lessons.”
But while she was at the blackboard, Billie Wagtail, the goat, fastened
a feather on a long stick, and, reaching over, tickled Mr. Longears.
This was more than the bunny could stand. He turned around and
Oh! he gave Billie such a look! And then something else happened.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>6. Being tickled by a goat’s feather—I mean by a feather the goat
boy had—was too much for Uncle Wiggily. “Billie, I’m going to tickle
you!” laughed Uncle Wiggily in his jolly voice. Then, forgetting all
about being in school, the bunny snatched the stick away from Billie
Wagtail and poked him in the ribs. “Oh, Ho! Ho! Ha! Ha!” laughed
the goat. “Uncle Wiggily, I’m surprised at you!” squeaked the Mouse.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i019.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>7. “Why did you tickle Billie with that stick, Uncle Wiggily?” asked
the Lady Mouse Teacher. “Oh, because,” answered the bunny. And
that was all he would say. He wouldn’t be a tattle-tale and tell on
Billie. No, indeed! “I’m sorry, but I shall have to ask you to stand
in the corner,” said the Lady Mouse. “I am afraid you aren’t doing
my children much good.” So Uncle Wiggily stood in the corner.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i020.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>8. All of a sudden, just as the Lady Mouse was going to ask the
Kindergarten Class to sing, there was a noise at the door and in burst
the bad old Skillery Scallery Alligator with the double-jointed tail.
“Oh, my goodness!” squeaked Miss Mouse “Don’t be afraid,” bellowed
the Alligator. “All I want are some nibbles from Uncle Wiggily’s
ears!” And the Skillery Scallery creature made a jump for the bunny.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>9. All of a sudden, just as the Alligator was going to grab him, Uncle
Wiggily blew chalk dust from the blackboard eraser into the eyes, nose
and mouth of the bad chap. “A-ker-choo! Ker-zoo! Ker-snitzium!”
sneezed the ’Gator, and he flopped a somersault and jumped out of the
window, not nibbling any ears at all. “Uncle Wiggily, I shall forgive
you because you saved us from the bad Alligator,” said Miss Mouse.</p>

NURSE JANE MADE A PUDDING AND SHE MADE<br />
IT HOT AND SWEET. THE DOGGIE BOYS SCRATCHED<br />
SNOW UPON THE ’GATOR WITH THEIR FEET. DIDN’T THEY?</p>

</div>

<div class='story chapter'>

<h2 class="hidden">Nurse Jane’s Pudding is Delivered to Mr. Bow Wow</h2>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i023.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>1. One day Nurse Jane said to Uncle Wiggily: “Here is a
fine hot snow pudding that I have made for Mr. Bow Wow, the
dog gentleman. Will you take it to him?” The bunny rabbit
twinkled his pink nose and said that he would. “Is Mr. Bow Wow
ill?” asked Uncle Wiggily. “Just a little cold,” answered nurse Jane.
“I think the hot snow pudding will do him good.” The bunny
laughed “Ha! Ha!”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i024.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>2. Uncle Wiggily, with the pail of hot snow pudding, hopped along
until he met Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow with their sled. “Oh, ho,
doggie boys!” cried the bunny. “I am taking this pail of hot pudding
to your father.” Then Jackie and Peetie barked joyfully and said they
would give the pudding a ride on their sled. “And maybe,” said Jackie
to Peetie, “when we get the pudding home we can have some.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i025.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>3. All of a sudden, as Jackie and Peetie were talking of how good
the snow pudding would taste (if they had any) all at once Uncle
Wiggily looked around and cried out: “Oh, the Wolf is coming after
us! He wants the snow pudding, I guess!” Then the bunny and the
doggie boys ran, and Jackie barked: “The Wolf can’t have daddy’s
pudding!” But the Wolf howled: “Zoo! Zoo! I’ll get that pudding!”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i026.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>4. Uncle Wiggily, Jackie and Peetie ran so fast with the pudding on
the sled that they kept ahead of the Wolf. But the bad chap ran
faster and he was almost catching up when, all of a sudden, the sled
struck a stone under the snow. “Oh, see what has happened!” barked
Jackie. For the tin pail of pudding bounced off the sled and hit the
Wolf on the end of his soft, tender nose, bumping and burning him.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i027.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>5. The Wolf was so frightened when the pail of pudding hit him on
the nose that he ran away. And, as the pudding wasn’t in the least
harmed, Uncle Wiggily picked it up and put it on the sled. “I’ll sit
with it and hold it,” said Jackie. Then, all of a sudden, the Bob Cat
began to chase after the three friends, howling: “I want ears! I want
ears!” Uncle Wiggily told the doggie boys not to be afraid.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i028.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>6. On and on raced Uncle Wiggily, helping Peetie pull the sled,
while Jackie sat on it holding the pudding. “Why shouldn’t we be
afraid, Uncle Wiggily?” asked Jackie. “How can you save us?”
The Bob Cat caught up to them and took the cover off the pudding
pail. Out popped the hot steam. “Oh, wow! I’m burned!” howled the
Bob Cat. “Just what I thought would happen!” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i029.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>7. The Bob Cat dropped the pail of pudding after it burned him.
Uncle Wiggily picked it up, put the cover back on the pail and started
off again. “You sit on the sled and I’ll ride you and the snow
pudding,” said the bunny. They had not gone very far before Jackie
howled: “Something is chasing us, Uncle Wiggily!” The bunny
asked who it was. “It’s the Skillery Scallery Alligator!”
said Peetie.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i030.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>8. Uncle Wiggily hopped as fast as he could, but still the ’Gator
came on. “Wait a minute, Uncle Wiggily!” barked Jackie. “Let
Peetie and I stop this bad chap from chasing us.” The bunny wanted
to know how the doggies could do this. “We’ll show you!” cried
Peetie. He and Jackie scratched so much snow in the eyes, nose and
mouth of the ’Gator that he could chase them no more.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i031.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>9. “Oh, wiffie-woofie!” howled the ’Gator as he felt the snow in
his face. “I must have run into a blizzard! This is too much!” He
turned about and ran home and the doggie boys hauled Uncle Wiggily
on the sled with the pudding to their house. “Why did Nurse Jane call
it a snow pudding?” asked the dog lady. “I guess because we had
such fun bringing it to you over the snow,” laughed Uncle Wiggily.</p>
